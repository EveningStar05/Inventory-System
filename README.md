This inventory system has some basic features, which inspired from point and click games:
- Add items: you can add items.
- Craft Item: you can craft items within the Inventory.
- Inspect item: you can double click an item in the inventory and a custom pop up window will show up.

Does not include dropping items to world (Main scene), coming soon!
